                        I just thought that I didn't want to spend a normal life.<br>
                        I wanted to make something bloom in my life.<br>
                        So I wanted to start a business.<br>
                        <br>
                        To that end, I started working on various businesses and products.<br>
                        But it didn't work.<br>
                        I didn't know why it didn't work, and I just lost my trust.<br>
                        <br>
                        I met a certain person at such time.<br>
                        He pointed out my bad personality.<br>
                        Selfishness, passive, uncaring, subjective, serial thinking, negative thinking<br>
                        So he told me that no matter what I did, it didn't work.<br>
                        I've thought that's right.<br>
                        I felt fascinated by his love and decided to follow.<br>
                        <br>
                        He also taught the principles, laws, mechanisms, and distortions of this world.<br>
                        He was the one who accepted both the front and back worlds.<br>
                        It embodies altruism, pioneering, compassion, objective, parallel thinking and positive
                        thinking.<br>
                        <br>
                        Guided by that, I have begun to follow the management path.<br>
                        Next is my turn to guide my juniors.<br>
                        To create a future where everyone's dreams can be realized.<br>
